- 👋 Hi, I’m @anindya6
- 👀 I’m interested in Security, Cryptography, Infrastructure and Cloud Engineering, alongside a bit of quant finance. I'm also looking to build impactful tech for the world, and it's something that really keeps me up at night!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning networks and routing, getting better with architecture and building scalable systems, learning the software stack entirely to execute at a chief technologist level as soon as possible. Also learning how to build a sustainable business model that is not inherently predatory!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to alleviate quality of life issues for people of all income levels. Happy to discuss software engineering and finance problems at length.
- 📫 How to reach me: Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anindyashankarbhandari/)!
- Lastly, I haven't uploaded code to any public repositories in Github for a 100 years. So if you come across my profile, know that all code here (that you can see) is from my school days.
